## Things I got to do for the project
- Have config file dictate what log file you want
- Allow having SSH keys and passwordless SSH sessions, along with having bypassing keys altogether
- Allow fetching of multiple log files (fields under the defined host? Seperate key/field? Dynamic?)
- Allow different machines to collect different log files
- Allow to gather directories of log files
